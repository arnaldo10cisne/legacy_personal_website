                <p>
                The pandemic that started in the first quarter of 2020, due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been and continues to be, an event that will mark a before and after in our lives, not only as individuals but also as a society. 
                <br><br>
                We cannot deny that it has been a moment in our history that many will remember with sadness. Some of us have had to quit our previous jobs, perhaps do things we have never been trained to do to survive, and we may even have had to say goodbye to a loved one or a family member.
                <br><br>
                We'll be able to share all these experiences with future generations, while we see expressions of disbelief appearing on their faces. But perhaps one of the most relevant consequences of this entire process can be summarized in a phrase that is now part of the lifestyle of many of us, especially when we work with technology or online: "Work from home."
                <br><br>
                Before this pandemic detonated, I was starting a new job in a small caf&eacute; in the city of Medell&iacute;n. I started this job on February 15th, 2020, and by March 15th I was unemployed again. The caf&eacute; was a new place, it hadn't been open for more than three months when I started. Four people worked there, including me. When I was told that I was no longer going to work with them because of the impending pandemic, I felt naively confident.&nbsp;<span style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">"I have many skills, I can speak English. I'll get another job quickly, this is just a temporary setback"</span>, I thought.
                <br><br>
                During the following days, I exhausted my energies handing out resumes in various restaurants and cafeterias:&nbsp;<span style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">"Do you need staff? I can be a waiter, and I also have experience in coffee bars and cocktails"</span>. I was never in love with the idea of being a waiter, or even working in a restaurant. But to get ahead, it was necessary. Unfortunately, that effort did not pay off, and after three weeks without receiving any reply, I began to despair.
                <br><br>
                It wasn't until two months after I lost my job at the cafe that my luck began to change, as I applied for a customer service job at a bilingual Call Center. The selection process was enormously distressing, as I knew that I did not have many other options, and if this didn't work out, I would have had to return to Venezuela empty-handed, after having emigrated three years earlier looking for a better future.
                <br><br>
                Working in a Call Center is an experience that many people look down on, but in my case, it was a real lifesaver, and today, 16 months later, it's impossible for me to feel more grateful. I completed the selection process and language tests, and May 1st, 2020, was my first day of training. Of course, we were told that the job, due to the circumstances, was to be completely remote and from home.
                <br><br>
                This would become my first experience working for a company outside of an office. Some benefits jumped immediately. The most notable of these, in my opinion, was saving time and money by omitting the need to use public transport daily (which was great). Then, being able to spend more time at my home, and having the advantage of lying on my bed during breaks is something you get used to quickly. And finally, the lack of uniforms, or working in a T-shirt and underwear are things that will stay with me forever.
                <br><br>
                However, during this time, I wasn't just working from home. I lived entirely in my house and did everything there. From exercising to building a social life. The Zoom application became as important as a web browser on my computer. And the only way to see the smile of my friends and family was through a screen.
                <br><br>
                Working from home also has its flaws. Due to being sedentary, I have gained a lot of weight that I'm still trying to lose. Many other times I also felt that the walls of my room were speaking to me. And the overall loneliness sometimes was difficult. However, if I was given the option to choose between working from home and working at the office, I am sure that I would choose my home since I believe it's a matter of finding the right balance. I favor an office-free model, where people can decide where they want to be each day.
                <br><br>
                Today, I continue working from home. But I seek to take care of myself not only physically, but mentally. Maintaining contact with friends is something that has raised my spirit enormously, and going for a walk, feeling the sun, even with a mask, cleanses you from the inside. I think that in the next few years, many people will return to the office, especially in the restaurant business. However, for me, I hope I can keep working remotely, but still have the option of going to the office only when I want to. There are so many places to explore, and so many wonderful people to meet out there… It's something I definitely won't want to miss.
